# 🛩️ Aerial Robotics – Minefield Navigation Challenge Resources

This repository contains curated **open-access papers, articles, and tutorials** to support the ideation stage for the Gujcost Robofest **Aerial Robotics: Minefield Navigation Challenge**.

The aim: equip the team with **concepts, examples, and terminology** to brainstorm and defend a complete swarm-drone-based minefield navigation solution — without wasting time on unnecessary deep theory.
